"JAkagNY2KaZ0gbEff33j","Dr. James was one of the most dedicated doctors at the city's busiest animal hospital. Every morning, he put on his favorite sunglasses and walked to work, where many dogs waited for their check ups. The hospital was always busy, but Dr. James and his fellow doctors loved their work.
One day, a golden retriever named Max arrived with his worried owner. Max had been acting strangely, refusing to eat or play. The doctors carefully examined him and discovered a small piece of plastic stuck in his teeth. Dr. James gently removed it, and Max immediately wagged his tail in relief.
""You're all miracle workers!"" the owner said, smiling.
Dr. James and his fellow doctors laughed. ""Sometimes, all it takes is a little care and attention,"" he said.
Later that day, another patient arrived, a tiny beagle with a broken leg. The doctors worked together to carefully place a cast on him, making sure he was comfortable. As Max happily ran outside, Dr. James adjusted his sunglasses, looking at the line of dogs still waiting.",175,"2025. 03. 13. 오후 02:48:07"
